## Copy Trading Platform

- copy trading refers to a feature that allows users to replicate any past transaction on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols by simply copying and pasting the transaction hash. This means that if a user sees a transaction they like or think is profitable, they can easily execute the same transaction in their own account without having to manually input all the details. The feature you developed works with blue-chip protocols such as Uniswap, AAVE, and Compound, which are well-known and widely used platforms in the DeFi space.
